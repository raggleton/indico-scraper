The current best measurements of the W boson mass come from single production measurements at hadron colliders in its decay mode to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino and pair production of W bosons at lepton colliders, where also the decay mode of the W boson to a quark anti-quark pair has been considered. In this study, prospects for a measurement of the W boson mass in the all-jets final state at hadron colliders are presented. Compared to other methods for measuring the W mass, a measurement in the all-jets final state would be complementary in methodology and have systematic uncertainties orthogonal to previous measurements. We have estimated the main experimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting a measurement in the all-jets final state making use of jet substructure techniques.'),\n",

Triggered by ongoing experimental analyses, we also report on the cross section ratio to the pp→e+νeμ−ν¯μbb¯ process.

Reduced cross sections are obtained in the kinematic range of negative four-momentum transfer squared of the photon $2.5$~GeV$^2\\\\le Q^2 \\\\le 2000$ GeV$^2$ and Bjorken scaling variable $3 \\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\le x_{\\\\rm Bj} \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^{-2}$. The combination method accounts for the correlations of the statistical and systematic uncertainties among the different datasets. Perturbative QCD calculations are compared to the combined data. A next-to-leading order QCD analysis is performed using these data together with the combined inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross sections from HERA. The running charm- and beauty-quark masses are determined as $m_c(m_c) = 1.290^{+0.046}_{-0.041} {\\\\rm (exp/fit)}$ ${}^{+0.062}_{-0.014}  {\\\\rm (model)}$ ${}^{+0.003}_{-0.031} {\\\\rm (parameterisation)}$ GeV and $m_b(m_b) = 4.049^{+0.104}_{-0.109} {\\\\rm (exp/fit)}$ ${}^{+0.090}_{-0.032} {\\\\rm (model)}$ ${}^{+0.001}_{-0.031} {\\\\rm (parameterisation)}$ GeV.'),\n",
