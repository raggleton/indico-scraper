The NLO QCD corrections to these contributions were evaluated in the approximation where electroweak boson masses were considered to be significantly larger than the mass of the Higgs boson and it is desirable to compute these corrections for physical masses of the gauge bosons and the Higgs boson.

The current best measurements of the W boson mass come from single production measurements at hadron colliders in its decay mode to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino and pair production of W bosons at lepton colliders, where also the decay mode of the W boson to a quark anti-quark pair has been considered. In this study, prospects for a measurement of the W boson mass in the all-jets final state at hadron colliders are presented. Compared to other methods for measuring the W mass, a measurement in the all-jets final state would be complementary in methodology and have systematic uncertainties orthogonal to previous measurements. We have estimated the main experimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting a measurement in the all-jets final state making use of jet substructure techniques.'),\n",

Reduced cross sections are obtained in the kinematic range of negative four-momentum transfer squared of the photon $2.5$~GeV$^2\\\\le Q^2 \\\\le 2000$ GeV$^2$ and Bjorken scaling variable $3 \\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\le x_{\\\\rm Bj} \\\\le 5 \\\\cdot 10^{-2}$. The combination method accounts for the correlations of the statistical and systematic uncertainties among the different datasets. Perturbative QCD calculations are compared to the combined data. A next-to-leading order QCD analysis is performed using these data together with the combined inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross sections from HERA. The running charm- and beauty-quark masses are determined as $m_c(m_c) = 1.290^{+0.046}_{-0.041} {\\\\rm (exp/fit)}$ ${}^{+0.062}_{-0.014}  {\\\\rm (model)}$ ${}^{+0.003}_{-0.031} {\\\\rm (parameterisation)}$ GeV and $m_b(m_b) = 4.049^{+0.104}_{-0.109} {\\\\rm (exp/fit)}$ ${}^{+0.090}_{-0.032} {\\\\rm (model)}$ ${}^{+0.001}_{-0.031} {\\\\rm (parameterisation)}$ GeV.'),\n",
